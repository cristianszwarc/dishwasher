Dishwasher control
-------------------------------

My brain-death dishwasher looks too nice to be discarded.

This code, an Arduino Nano and some relays are more than enough to bring it back to live (in a secure way).

**Features**
- Less than 300 lines.
- 2 programs (full and rinse only).
- Water pressure aware.
